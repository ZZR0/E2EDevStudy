# E2EDevStudy

This repository contains the code and data for the E2EDevStudy project. The project is designed to facilitate end-to-end development studies, from data collection to evaluation.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

- `/data`: This directory is intended to store the datasets used and generated by the project.
- `/collect_data`: This directory contains scripts for collecting and processing data.
- `/harness`: This directory includes scripts and utilities for running evaluations.

## `/collect_data`

This directory provides scripts to build datasets for evaluation.

- `get_top_PyPI_package.py`: Fetches a list of the top Python packages from PyPI.
- `get_top_github_repo.py`: Retrieves popular GitHub repositories.
- `judge_good_repo.py`: Contains logic to filter and select repositories that are suitable for the study.
- `build_dataset.py`: The main script that orchestrates the process of building the final dataset from the collected repositories.
- `generate_eval_input.py`: Generates the input files required for the evaluation harness.
- `run_validation.py`: Runs validation checks on the generated dataset.

### `/collect_data/utils`

This subdirectory contains utility modules for data collection:

- `llm.py`: Provides helper functions to interact with large language models.
- `prompts.py`: Stores various prompts used for data generation and interaction with language models.
- `repo_info.py`: Includes functions for cloning, analyzing, and extracting information from Git repositories.
- `utils.py`: A collection of general-purpose utility functions.

## `/harness`

This directory contains the evaluation harness for running experiments.

- `run_eval_llm.py`: Script to run evaluations using a large language model. This is a comprehensive script with over 2000 lines of code, forming the core of the evaluation harness.
- `run_eval_scratch.py`: A script to run evaluations from scratch.
- `run_eval_skeleton.py`: A script for running evaluations on a skeleton or template project.
- `docker_utils.py`: Provides utilities for interacting with Docker, likely for creating sandboxed evaluation environments.

### `/harness/utils`

This subdirectory contains utility modules for the evaluation harness:

- `constants.py`: Defines constants used across the evaluation harness.
- `dockerfiles.py`: Manages Dockerfile templates or generation.
- `utils.py`: General utility functions specific to the harness.
